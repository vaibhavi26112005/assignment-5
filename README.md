Task 1 – Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This task stores student names and their marks in a dictionary. When the user enters a student’s name, the program searches the dictionary for that name. If it exists, the corresponding marks are displayed. If it does not exist, the message "Student not found" is shown. This demonstrates how to use dictionaries for quick lookups and how to handle cases where data is missing.

Task 2 – Demonstrate List Slicing
This task works with a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It extracts the first five elements from the list using slicing, then reverses these elements while keeping the original list unchanged. Finally, it displays both the extracted portion and its reversed version. This demonstrates the use of list slicing to select specific parts of a list and reverse them without affecting the original list.
